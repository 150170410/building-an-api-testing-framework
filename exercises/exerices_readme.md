# Exercises

Each exercise is described in a separate file. Reason for this is that each exercise builds on
the previous one - often solving a problem with what you have built so far.  

Example solutions can be found in the `example_solutions` directory.  

Note that different solutions to each exercise are possible. The example solutions have been created
to most clearly illustrate the purpose of the exercise.  

As you proceed through the exercises and as your framework and tests grow, you will probably
need to refactor what you have so far. So you have two options:
- keep editing the same file
- create a new file for each exercise copy-pasting what you need from the previous exercise
