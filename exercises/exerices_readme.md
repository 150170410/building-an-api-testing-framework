# Exercises

Below are the descriptions of the exercises, including the learning goal.  

Example solutions can be found in the `example_solutions` directory.  

Note that different solutions are possible.
As your framework and tests grow, you will probably move from one solution to a different one. The example
solutions have been created to most clearly illustrate the purpose of the exercise.  

Also note that because of the limited scope of the exercises, the solutions seem over-elaborate.
