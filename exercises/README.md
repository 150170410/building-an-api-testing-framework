# Exercises

Each exercise is described in a separate file. Reason for this is that each exercise builds on
the previous one - often solving a problem with what you have built so far.  
A good practice is to ask before each exercise: what is the next thing I should do to improve the framework?  

Example solutions can be found in the `example_solutions` directory.  

Note that different solutions to each exercise are possible. The example solutions have been created
to most clearly illustrate the purpose of the exercise.  

As you proceed through the exercises and as your framework and tests grow, you will probably
need to refactor what you have so far. So you have two options:
- keep editing the same file throughout the exercises;
- create a new file for each exercise copy-pasting what you need from the previous exercise.

**Important**
- Read the exercise descriptions carefully. There's more information in them than you think.
- Make sure the virtual environment you created during setup, is active when running the app
and when running the code you wrote. If you need to check, there are two ways to do this:
    - If supported by your command-line, the prompt will start with the name of the virtual environment, i.e. `(venv)`.
    - Alternatively do the following:
        - Type `python` to start the interactive python interpreter
        - Type `import sys; print(sys.prefix)`, this will print a path.
        - Check if the path matches the directory where you installed the virtual environment.
        - Type `exit()` to lave the interactive python interpreter.
